## Let's Connect on Handshake Mercenary - Free Forum for HNS Enthusiasts

Recently (Mid Jan 2021) SkyInclude invested in setting up a forum for Handshake enthusiasts to talk about buying / selling / dealing with the TLDs, as well as to discuss pricing and other trends. Called Handshake [Mercenary](http://mercenary.hns.to).

Signup free on HNS at:
[handshake.mercenary](http://handshake.mercenary) - HNS resolver required to signup.

No HNS Resolver? Come on, get that setup to support the ecosystme and well - get one! But if you want to browse, [Handshake.Mercenary.Hns.To](http://handshake.mercenary.hns.to) - use HNS.to



## Disrupting the old DNS

DNS (Domain Name Service) is using the old internet and a closed system controlled by a few.

Yet the internet is meant to be an open web.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to have a blockchain enabled DNS? One that isn‚Äôt controlled by large private corporations who rent to use their domain naming system on a yearly basis?



## In comes HNS

Handshake, and Namebase is leading the charge - to create a blockchain enabled DNS called HNS. 


HNS is the coin, the currency, that enables this to be made and maintained.
